Morse code typing using separate inputs for dot and dash

One of the difficulties in learning and using Morse code is that there are several timing specifications: dot duration, dash duration, and pause durations between elements, characters, and words. Using two distinct inputs for dot and dash decreases the number of timing specifications and makes it easier to learn and use Morse code for text entry.

## learning Morse code

There are many resources out there for learning Morse code, but one good one is [Hello Morse](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/morse).

Extensions to Morse code are included for:
* space     dot-dot-dash-dash
* backspace dash-dash-dash-dash

## run tests
__TODO: write tests for golang__

## TODO
* write go library which processes input sequences
* write unit tests
* write main which gets inputs, displays outputs
